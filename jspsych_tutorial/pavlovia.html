        Here we import pavlovia.  This is imported from a relative directory that is not
        contained within our local files.  The files are contained within the pavlovia server.
        Whenever we import files that we do not have locally, the experiment can only be run on the server that contains
        the files.  Meaning that if we try to run this experiment locally, it will fail.  We must
        upload this experiment to https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/ and run it through Pavlovia for this
        line not to fail.

    // To run this experiment on Pavlovia we must first rename this file
    // from pavlovia.html to index.html.  index.html is the special name given to the
    // main html file in a repository.  Pavlovia will look for this file and execute the
    // experiment described within it.

    // Live server will also look for index.html and execute that if it finds it, but will
    // give the option to run any other file if its not found.  Pavlovia isn't as forgiving
    // and will crash if no index.html file is present.  So make sure to change the file back
    // to pavlovia.html before trying to run any other files locally.

    // In order to run this experiment we must upload it to https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/
    // Instructions on uploading to gitlab can be found in Ara's great Git Guide.
    // https://www.notion.so/mindinsocietylab/Version-Control-Resources-Git-498096fa0bf44954ae46863e895b6d0e

    // Once uploaded, sign in to https://pavlovia.org/ and navigate to dashboard -> experiments
    // Here a experiment with the name of the repository should be seen.  If this is your
    // first time running the experiment, you must first change the status of the experiment from
    // inactive to piloting.  Then the experiment can be run with the "Piloting".

    // When an experiment is ready to go live, change the status to "Running", and a link will
    // be provided for distribution to participants.
