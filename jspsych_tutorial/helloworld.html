<!--

    Welcome to your first html document.  HTML documents are made of many parts, however
    we are only concerned with two places.  The first is the head section, this is where
    we will import other files that can be used later.  The second is the script section.
    The script section is where we will create the experiment and tell JsPsych how to run it.

<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- What kind of document we are working in (Don't change this) -->
<html lang="en"> <!-- What language the document is in (english) (Don't change this) -->

<head>
    <title>Hello World!</title> <!-- The title of the page to be displayed in the tab -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">  <!-- What characters we are working in (Don't change this)-->


    <!--
        Links with the attribute rel="stylesheet" tell the webpage how to style the experiment
        here we are using the standard css file that jsPsych provides
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/jspsych@7.0.0/css/jspsych.css">

    <!--
        Script tags let us import code from other files or even over the internet.  In this
        example we are pulling the base jsPsych from a website called unpkg.com.
    -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/jspsych@7.2.3"></script>

    <!--
        Along with the base jsPsych we need to import all the plugins that we want to use.
        We will cover plugins more down the line, but plugins are templates, that make
        up the experiment when provided with data.

        Here we are importing the html-button-response plugin.
    -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@jspsych/plugin-html-button-response@1.1.1"></script>

<!--
    All html files are required to have a body.  In most webpages this is where the majority of the
    information for the webpage is found, however we will be using JsPsych to create the webpages
    so we leave this blank.
-->
<body></body>

<!-- Inside script is where we will write all the code that creates the website-->
<script>

    // Anything written inside the script tag is read as javascript and not as an html document.

    // The first step in creating a JsPsych experiment is to initialize JsPsych.

    var jsPsych = initJsPsych({});

    // JsPsych works by creating a timeline, comprised of webpages made from jsPsych plugins,
    // and telling jsPsych to run all the plugins

    // The timeline array will hold all the webpages.

    var timeline = [];

    // We will create our first webpage using the html-button-response plugin that we imported in the
    // header section of the file.

    // There are many different ways that you can customize these plugins, the best way to
    // learn all the different attributes that can be customized is by going to the documentation
    // on the JsPsych website (https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/).  For example all the options that
    // can be given to html button response can be found here
    // (https://www.jspsych.org/7.0/plugins/html-button-response/).

    // Here we create a jsPsychHtmlButtonResponse plugin, and pass in two pieces of data, the
    // stimulus that is show, and the choices that are presented.

    var helloWorld = {
        type : jsPsychHtmlButtonResponse,
        stimulus: "Hello World?",
        choices: ["Yes, Hello World!", "No, Goodbye World!"]
    };

    // Once we have a plugin created that we have customized, we need to add it to the timeline.

    timeline.push(helloWorld);

    // Once the timeline is created we just tell JsPsych to run it!

    jsPsych.run(timeline);

    // To run this experiment ensure that live server is installed.
    // 1. press "Go Live" in the bottom right.
    // 2. Open a web browser and go to (http://localhost:5500/)
    // 3. Select helloworld.html
