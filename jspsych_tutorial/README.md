# Mind In Society Lab JsPsych and Pavlovia Tutorial

Welcome to the Mind In Society Lab's JsPsych and Pavlovia Tutorial repository! This tutorial is designed for research assistants who are new to programming and want to learn how to use jsPsych and Pavlovia to create experiments for psychological research.

## Code Stack

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used for creating dynamic and interactive content on web pages. It is the backbone of modern web development, enabling developers to enhance user experience by adding features such as animations, form validation, and interactive elements. JavaScript runs on the client side, meaning it executes code directly within the user's web browser, making it an essential tool for creating responsive and engaging experiments.

### JsPsych

JsPsych is a JavaScript library for creating and running behavioral experiments in a web browser. It provides a flexible and powerful framework for designing experiments using a variety of tasks, stimuli, and response collection methods. With jsPsych, researchers can easily create experiments ranging from simple reaction time tasks to complex multi-trial studies.

### Pavlovia

Pavlovia is an online platform for running experiments created with jsPsych. It allows researchers to host and deploy experiments online, collect data remotely, and manage participants and experiments efficiently. Pavlovia provides a seamless integration with jsPsych, enabling researchers to easily share their experiments with participants and other researchers worldwide.

## Javascript Tutorial

While this tutorial focuses on using JavaScript specifically within the context of jsPsych and Pavlovia, it's important to note that a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals is highly beneficial. If you're new to JavaScript or need to brush up on the basics, there are many resources available online. We recommend visiting [Learn JS's Tutorial](https://www.learn-js.org/) to access comprehensive tutorials covering essential JavaScript concepts. Familiarizing yourself with these basics will enhance your learning experience and proficiency in using JavaScript for creating experiments with jsPsych and Pavlovia.

## Development Environment


For an optimal development experience, we highly recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as your integrated development environment (IDE) for creating experiments with jsPsych and Pavlovia. Visual Studio Code is a lightweight yet powerful IDE with a wide range of features, including built-in debugging tools, syntax highlighting, and intelligent code completion. Additionally, we suggest installing the Live Server extension, which allows you to easily launch a local server to run your experiment in a web browser. This setup enables you to debug and test your experiment locally before pushing the code to Pavlovia, ensuring a smoother development process and quicker iteration of your experimental designs. With Visual Studio Code and the Live Server extension, you'll have a reliable and efficient environment for building and refining your experiments with ease.

## Version Control


We use Git to version control our experiments primarily for its efficient collaboration features and robust tracking capabilities. Git allows multiple team members to work on the experiment simultaneously without risking conflicts, thanks to its branching and merging functionalities. Additionally, it provides a clear history of changes, enabling easy rollback to previous versions if needed. This ensures smoother collaboration, higher code quality, and better experiment management throughout the development process.

Ara has created a [wonderful guide](https://www.notion.so/mindinsocietylab/Version-Control-Resources-Git-498096fa0bf44954ae46863e895b6d0e) on how to use git in the lab.  Her guide can be found on our Notion.

Once you have Visual Studio Code installed, along with the Live Server extension and a comfortable understanding of JavaScript, navigate to the "[helloworld.html](helloworld.html)" file to begin exploring and experimenting with jsPsych and Pavlovia functionalities.

## Useful Plugins

There are many different vsCode extensions that can make working with these technologies more fruitful.  Below are a list of optional plugins that you may want to consider installing to make life a little easier. I would recommend starting without them, only installing them when there is a need to.

### Web Development and JavaScript Plugins

- CSS Peek: Easily look up CSS classes and IDs directly in HTML files
- HTML CSS Support: Auto-completion for CSS classes and IDs within HTML documents
- Auto Rename Tag: Change all HTML tags at once
- Jest: JavaScript tester (Useful if building larger and more scalable software)
- ESLint: JavaScript Linter (Forces the use of good code style and formatting)
- Prettier: Code formatter to automatically format code to maintain a consistent style and readability
- Auto Import: Imports and manages JavaScript dependencies.  (Useful if building software that relies on other files)

### General Coding Plugins

- Path Intellisense: Auto-completion for file paths
- Code Spell Checker: Helps correct typos and spelling mistakes
- TODO Highlight : Highlights TODO comments for quicker workflow

### Data Management and Visualization

- Rainbow CSV: Highlights columns of CSV files different colors, so they can be read easily
- Image preview: Provides a hover preview of images referenced in code
- Color Highlights: Highlights color codes in CSS file with actual colors
