Purpose:
    Did police departements change the language they use in their websites after the George Floyd killing in May of 2020.

Data:

    A Lot overlap

    Fall 2022 RA Annotations (2000):
        Name
        URL
        Location
        WayBack Data - some missing
        Annotations - inconsistant

    Department List RA Annotations (2000):
        Name
        URL
        Size
        Location

    All Qualtrics URLS (315) w/ text extractions

    WebScraper could be done with requests + beautriful soup to pull relevant information
    CBOW to vector
    Binary classifier afterwords


Idea 2:
