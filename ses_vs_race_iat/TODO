40 classification images to choose from 20 community 20 traditional instead of ori inv

set of continious choices between two pictures instead of binary choices

4 blocks per condition

1 condition:

shuffle the 20 pairs together

divide 5 per block

each of the 5 pairs have a set of continuous choices

randomize what side they're on

block:

2 conditions
slideshow (4 per condition)
couple generic survey questions where you choose from a distinct list dot matrix (Slideshow Survey) (1 per block)
continuous choice questions from the officers (Officer Comparison) (5 per block)
Allocation of officer pairs to blocks is the same across conditions

Place holders for questions and number of questions

add another task for survey questions
